                The mass of one mole of a substance in unified atomic mass units.

                The molecular mass (m) of a substance is the mass of one molecule of that substance,
                in unified atomic mass unit(s) u (equal to 1/12 the mass of one atom of the isotope
                carbon-12). This is numerically equivalent to the relative molecular mass (Mr) of a
                molecule, frequently referred to by the term molecular weight, which is the ratio of
                the mass of that molecule to 1/12 of the mass of carbon-12 and is a dimensionless
                number. Thus, it is incorrect to express relative molecular mass (molecular weight)
                in daltons (Da). Unfortunately, the terms molecular weight and molecular mass have
                been confused on numerous websites, which often state that molecular weight was used
                in the past as another term for molecular mass.

                Molecular mass differs from more common measurements of the mass of chemicals, such
                as molar mass, by taking into account the isotopic composition of a molecule rather
                than the average isotopic distribution of many molecules. As a result, molecular mass
                is a more precise number than molar mass; however it is more accurate to use molar
                mass on bulk samples. This means that molar mass is appropriate most of the time
                except when dealing with single molecules.

           dataType="xsd:double" unitType="unitType:amount" units="unit:amu">
        <definition>
            <xhtml:p>
                The mass per amount of substance.

                Molar mass, symbol M, is a physical property characteristic of a given substance
                (chemical element or chemical compound), namely its mass per amount of substance.
                The base SI unit for mass is the kilogram and that for amount of substance is
                the mole. Thus, the derived unit for molar mass is kg/mol. However, for both
                practical and historical reasons, molar masses are almost always quoted in grams
                per mole (g/mol or g mol−1), especially in chemistry.

            <xhtml:p>
                Molar mass is closely related to the relative molar mass (Mr) of a compound, the
                older term formula weight and to the standard atomic masses of its constituent
                elements. However, it should be distinguished from the molecular mass (also
                known as molecular weight), which is the mass of one molecule (of any single
                isotopic composition) and is not directly related to the atomic mass, the mass
                of one atom (of any single isotope). The dalton, symbol Da, is also sometimes
                used as a unit of molar mass, especially in biochemistry, with the definition
                1 Da = 1 g/mol, despite the fact that it is strictly a unit of molecular mass
                (1 Da = 1.660 538 782(83)×10−27 kg).
